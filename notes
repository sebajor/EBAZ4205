First I made the modification mention in https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205 to set the root password

In my case the board is booting from the nandflash and in that case the eth0 is down, to bring it up you have to issue:
    ip addr add 192.168.0.100/24 dev eth0 
    ip link set up dev eth0

If you want to have the eth dev from booting you have to modify /etc/network/interfaces
In my case I add the following lines:
    
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.100
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.0.1

Then you could connect to the board using ssh


I note that when I upload a bit file into the fpga the eth goes down,I assume my board doesnt comes with the phy clock for the eth so is generated by the ps.
